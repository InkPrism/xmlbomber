# xmlbomber
Script to create a XML bomb

An XML bomb is a piece of XML code that is syntactically valid and correct but can cause a program that compiles or runs it to crash or hang. An XML bomb can be used to test the security level of a server. In an HTML code, an XML code is either parsed internally or referenced as an external file that is sent to a server. Typically, a normal server without adequate protection is expected to crash with this attack.
